### Setting Development Environment
For this project, we decided to use the MERN stack. Here are the steps to setup your dev environment. Note that you should change your directory to backend folder, i.e. your working directory should look like `../web-app/backend`.
```sh
npm install
```
That's all.

### Running API
Before running the following command, note that you should change your directory to backend/src folder, i.e. your working directory should look like `../web-app/backend`.
```sh
npm run dev
```
